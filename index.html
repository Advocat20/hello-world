        So they built a fortress in a place called La Isabela and  then  left  again.</p>

        But soon the Spaniards started to <em>dislike</em> the Indiands and  decided  to enslave or kill them.<br> They were quite efficient  at  this  and  soon most  of  the  indian  population was <strong>extinguished</strong>. </p>
